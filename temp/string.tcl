substrings "For everybody asking, yes this is his song. I have a good handful of his tracks that were on his soundcloud before the release of While (1<2). There was 4 versions of this song before he split it into Avaritia, and Phantoms Can't Hang. Unfortunately this was the time that he had told everyone to keep an eye out for a date in November of 2013, leading people to believe it was an album release date, only to delete everything from his twitter, and Soundcloud, and leave the 7 tracks that are the 7 deadly sins. I'm glad I managed to grab a lot of that stuff before it was gone. He is without doubt one of the best producers in the world. I get the feeling his emotional state reflects in his music, hence the sudden darkening of his tracks.ï»¿"
